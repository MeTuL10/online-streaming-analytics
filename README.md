# online-streaming-analytics

The goal of this project is to analyse twitch streamers data to find the relation between various attributes.
Models are applied to split streamers into various tiers based on their attributes and classifcation models are applied on these clusters to analyse their performance and choose the best model.
A sample preprocessing program is also made to preprocess invalid data which have been added to the dataset to understand the different techniques that can be performed for preprocessing
